# Tech-Blogger

This is a CMS-style Tech Blog. You're presented with a homepage that shows all the current posts. The navigation bar at the top gives the user the option of going to the homepage, dashboard, or login page.

On the login page, the user is given the ability to login with Username and Password. If an account hasn't been created yet, you can signup a new user.

Once logged in, the user will be directed to their dashboard where they can view all of their own posts, or create a new one. If the User selects an existing post, they can edit or delete the post.

On the homepage, clicking on a post title will open the post. The user can comment on the posts.
